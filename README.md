# Ripple
An effect similar to Google's Material UI button click animation or Vuetify ripple effect.

## Installation
Add the JavaScript file to the HTML file.
```HTML
<body>
  <div id="main">
    <div class="ripple"></div>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Add script here pointing to the directory it's in (in this case ./js/)-->
  <script src="./js/ripple.js"></script>
</body>
```

Once added, you will then be able to use the ripple effect.

## Usage

```HTML
<div class="ripple"></div>
```
